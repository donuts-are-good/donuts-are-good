## challenge 2025

Build something that reaches 1M users.

## challenge 2024

2024 I didn't have a goal of one project per week so it wasn't about getting the numbers, it was about building something that mattered.

## challenge 2023

generated with https://github.com/donuts-are-good/github-scoreboard 


2023 is dedicated to one project per week. Most of these are stdlib, vanilla, and put together in the span of a laptop charge or some other difficulty modifier. No reason, just fun.
